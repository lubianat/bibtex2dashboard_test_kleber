In this paper, the authors present XML and examine its use as a data language for bioinformatics. In particular, XML is compared to other languages, and some of the potential uses of XML in bioinformatics applications are presented. The authors propose to adopt XML for data interchange between databases and other sources of data. Finally the discussion is illustrated by a test case of a pedigree data model in XML.},

We discuss seven meta-analytic practices, misconceptions, claims, and assumptions that have reached the status of myths and urban legends (MULs). These seven MULs include issues related to data collection (e.g., consequences of choices made in the process of gathering primary-level studies to be included in a meta-analysis), data analysis (e.g., effects of meta-analytic choices and technical refinements on substantive conclusions and recommendations for practice), and the interpretation of results (e.g., meta-analytic inferences about causal relationships). We provide a critical analysis of each of these seven MULs, including a discussion of why each merits being classified as an MUL, their kernels of truth value, and what part of each MUL represents misunderstanding. As a consequence of discussing each of these seven MULs, we offer best-practice recommendations regarding how to conduct meta-analytic reviews.},

It is widely recognized that successful data integration is one of the keys to improve productivity for stored data. Through proper data integration tools and algorithms, researchers may correlate relationships that enable them to make better and faster decisions. The need for data integration is essential for present -omics community, because -omics data is currently spread world wide in wide variety of formats. These formats can be integrated and migrated across platforms through different techniques and one of the important techniques often used is XML. XML is used to provide a document markup language that is easier to learn, retrieve, store and transmit. It is semantically richer than HTML. Here, we describe bio warehousing, database federation, controlled vocabularies and highlighting the XML application to store, migrate and validate -omics data.},

  abstract = {Science is an enormously successful human enterprise. The study ofscientific method is the attempt to discern the activities by whichthat success is achieved. Among the activities often identified ascharacteristic of science are systematic observation andexperimentation, inductive and deductive reasoning, and the formationand testing of hypotheses and theories. How these arecarried out in detail can vary greatly, but characteristics like thesehave been looked to as a way of demarcating scientific activity fromnon-science, where only enterprises which employ some canonical formof scientific method or methods should be considered science (see alsothe entry onscience and pseudo-science).  On the other hand, more recent debate has questioned whether there isanything like a fixed toolkit of methods which is common acrossscience and only science., Scientific method should be distinguished from the aims andproducts of science, such as knowledge, predictions, orcontrol. Methods are the means by which those goals areachieved. Scientific method should also be distinguished frommeta-methodology, which includes the values and justifications behinda particular characterizationof scientific method (i.e., a methodology) \textemdash values such as objectivity, reproducibility, simplicity,or past successes. Methodological rules are proposed to govern methodand it is a meta-methodological question whether methods obeying thoserules satisfy given values.  Finally, method is distinct, to some degree, fromthe detailed and contextual practices through which methods areimplemented. The latter might range over: specific laboratorytechniques; mathematical formalisms or other specialized languagesused in descriptions and reasoning; technological or other materialmeans; ways of communicating and sharing results, whether with otherscientists or with the public at large; or the conventions, habits,enforced customs, and institutional controls over how and what scienceis carried out., While it is important to recognize these distinctions, theirboundaries are fuzzy. Hence, accounts of method cannot be entirelydivorced from their methodological and meta-methodological motivationsor justifications, Moreover, each aspect plays a crucial role inidentifying methods. Disputes about method have therefore played outat the detail, rule, and meta-rule levels. Changes in beliefs aboutthe certainty or fallibility of scientific knowledge, for instance(which is a meta-methodological consideration of what we can hope formethods to deliver), have meant different emphases on deductive andinductive reasoning, or on the relative importance attached toreasoning over observation (i.e., differences over particularmethods.) Beliefs about the role of science in society will affect theplace one gives to values in scientific method. , The issue which has shaped debates over scientific method the most inthe last half century is the question of how pluralist do we need to beabout method? Unificationists continue to hold out for one methodessential to science; nihilism is a form of radical pluralism, whichconsiders the effectiveness of any methodological prescription to beso context sensitive as to render it not explanatory on its own. Somemiddle degree of pluralism regarding the methods embodied inscientific practice seems appropriate. But the details of scientificpractice vary with time and place, from institution toinstitution, across scientists and their subjects ofinvestigation. How significant are the variations for understandingscience and its success? How much can method be abstracted frompractice? This entry describes some of the attempts tocharacterize scientific method or methods, as well as arguments for a morecontext-sensitive approach to methods embedded in actual scientificpractices.},

The basic business practices between libraries and publishers for selling and buying the content, however, have not changed much. In protest against the high subscription prices of mainstream publishers, scientists have started Open Access (OA) journals and e-print repositories, which distribute scientific information freely. Despite widespread agreement among academics that OA would be the optimal distribution mode for publicly financed research results, such channels still constitute only a marginal phenomenon in the global scholarly communication system. This paper discusses, in view of the experiences of the last ten years, the many barriers hindering a rapid proliferation of Open Access. The discussion is structured according to the main OA channels; peer-reviewed journals for primary publishing, subjectspecific and institutional repositories for secondary parallel publishing. It also discusses the types of barriers, which can be classified as consisting of the legal framework, the information technology infrastructure, business models, indexing services and standards, the academic reward system, marketing, and critical mass.},

The basic question of reduction is whether the properties,concepts, explanations, or methods from one scientific domain(typically at higher levels of organization) can be deduced from orexplained by the properties, concepts, explanations, or methods fromanother domain of science (typically at lower levels of organization).Reduction is germane to a variety of issues in philosophy of science,including the structure of scientific theories, the relations betweenscientific disciplines, the nature of explanation, the diversity ofmethodology, and notions of theoretical progress, as well as tonumerous topics in metaphysics and philosophy of mind, such asemergence, mereology, and supervenience., In philosophy of biology, debates about reduction have focused on thequestion of whether and in what sense classical genetics can bereduced to molecular biology. Although other strands of discussionhave been present (e.g., whether evolutionary theory is inherentlyanti-reductionist because of the principle of natural selection),philosophical debates increasingly address a wider array of domains(e.g., development, ecology, evolution, cell biology, andneuroscience), and include additional questions about the nature andstatus of interdisciplinarity, such as the integration of data orstandards across biological fields. Questions about reduction inbiology are pervasive throughout the history of philosophy andscience. Many contemporary debates have historical analogues thatreflect long-standing controversies about the legitimacy ofreductionist research strategies and modes of explanation used bydifferent life science subdisciplines.},

However, the proliferation of computational research has changed how scientists can conduct science, opening the door to postdoctoral work being conducted remotely. Research activities primarily involving quantitative analysis, modeling, writing, and data collection can take place anywhere and therefore can all be conducted on a remote or semi-remote basis. We offer 10 simple rules for overcoming challenges and leveraging the unique opportunities presented by remote postdoc positions, derived from our experiences as either remote postdocs or the PIs who have mentored them. We believe that not only will these suggestions increase the desirability of remote postdoc positions whenever they are feasible, but that they also contain good practices for facilitating better communication both within labs more generally and in other long-distance collaborations.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Introduction             As biomedical research becomes more data-intensive, computational reproducibility is a growing area of importance. Unfortunately, many biomedical researchers have not received formal computational training and often struggle to produce results that can be reproduced using the same data, code, and methods. Programming workshops can be a tool to teach new computational methods, but it is not always clear whether researchers are able to use their new skills to make their work more computationally reproducible.                                   Methods             This mixed methods study consisted of in-depth interviews with 14 biomedical researchers before and after participation in an introductory programming workshop. During the interviews, participants described their research workflows and responded to a quantitative checklist measuring reproducible behaviors. The interview data was analyzed using a thematic analysis approach, and the pre and post workshop checklist scores were compared to assess the impact of the workshop on computational reproducibility of the researchers' workflows.                                   Results             Pre and post scores on a checklist of reproducible behaviors did not increase in a statistically significant manner. The qualitative interviews revealed that several participants had made small changes to their workflows including switching to open source programming languages for their data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Overall many of the participants indicated higher levels of programming literacy and an interest in further training. Factors that enabled change included supportive environments and an immediate research need, while barriers included collaborators that were resistant to new tools and a lack of time.                                   Conclusion             While none of the participants completely changed their workflows, many of them did incorporate new practices, tools, or methods that helped make their work more reproducible and transparent to other researchers. This indicate that programming workshops now offered by libraries and other organizations contribute to computational reproducibility training for researchers},

  abstract = {Good science'' means answering important questions convincingly, a challenging endeavor under the best of circumstances. Our inability to replicate many biomedical studies has been the subject of numerous commentaries both in the scientific and lay press. In response, statistics has re-emerged as a necessary tool to improve the objectivity of study conclusions. However, psychological aspects of decision making introduce preconceived preferences into scientific judgment that cannot be eliminated by any statistical method. The psychology of decision making, expounded by Kahneman, Tversky, and Thayer, is well known in the field of economics, but the underlying concepts of cognitive psychology are also relevant to scientific judgments. I repeated experiments carried out on undergraduates by Kahneman and colleagues four to five decades ago, but with scientists, and obtained essentially the same results. The experiments were in the form of written reactions to scenarios, and participants were scientists at all career stages. The findings reinforce the roles that two inherent intuitions play in scientific decision making: our drive to create a coherent narrative from new data regardless of its quality or relevance and our inclination to seek patterns in data whether they exist or not. Moreover, we do not always consider how likely a result is regardless of its p value. Low statistical power and inattention to principles underpinning Bayesian statistics reduce experimental rigor, but mitigating skills can be learned. Overcoming our natural human tendency to make quick decisions and jump to conclusions is a deeper obstacle to doing good science; this too can be learned.},

The need for data-sharing standards and neuroinformatics infrastructure is more pressing than ever. However, `big science' efforts are not the only drivers of data-sharing needs, as neuroscientists across the full spectrum of research grapple with the overwhelming volume of data being generated daily and a scientific environment that is increasingly focused on collaboration. In this commentary, we consider the issue of sharing of the richly diverse and heterogeneous small data sets produced by individual neuroscientists, so-called long-tail data. We consider the utility of these data, the diversity of repositories and options available for sharing such data, and emerging best practices. We provide use cases in which aggregating and mining diverse long-tail data convert numerous small data sources into big data for improved knowledge about neurosciencerelated disorders.},

It provides us with knowledge of the physical world, and itis experiment that provides the evidence that grounds this knowledge.Experiment plays many roles in science. One of its important roles isto test theories and to provide the basis for scientific knowledge.[1] It can also call for a new theory, either byshowing that an accepted theory is incorrect, or by exhibiting a newphenomenon that is in need of explanation. Experiment can provide hintstoward the structure or mathematical form of a theory and it canprovide evidence for the existence of the entities involved in ourtheories. Finally, it may also have a life of its own, independent oftheory. Scientists may investigate a phenomenon just because it looksinteresting. Such experiments may provide evidence for a future theoryto explain. [Examples of these different roles will be presentedbelow.] As we shall see below, a single experiment may play several ofthese roles at once., If experiment is to play these important roles in science then wemust have good reasons to believe experimental results, for science isa fallible enterprise. Theoretical calculations, experimental results,or the comparison between experiment and theory may all be wrong.Science is more complex than ``The scientist proposes, Nature disposes.''It may not always be clear what the scientist is proposing. Theoriesoften need to be articulated and clarified. It also may not be clearhow Nature is disposing. Experiments may not always give clear-cutresults, and may even disagree for a time., In what follows, the reader will find an epistemology of experiment,a set of strategies that provides reasonable belief in experimentalresults. Scientific knowledge can then be reasonably based on theseexperimental results.},

Thecentrality of models such as the billiard ball model of a gas, the Bohrmodel of the atom, the MIT bag model of the nucleon, the Gaussian-chainmodel of a polymer, the Lorenz model of the atmosphere, theLotka-Volterra model of predator-prey interaction, the double helixmodel of DNA, agent-based and evolutionary models in the socialsciences, and general equilibrium models of markets in their respectivedomains are cases in point. Scientists spend a great deal of timebuilding, testing, comparing and revising models, and much journalspace is dedicated to introducing, applying and interpreting thesevaluable tools. In short, models are one of the principal instrumentsof modern science., Philosophers are acknowledging the importance of models withincreasing attention and are probing the assorted roles that modelsplay in scientific practice. The result has been an incredibleproliferation of model-types in the philosophical literature. Probingmodels, phenomenological models, computational models, developmentalmodels, explanatory models, impoverished models, testing models,idealized models, theoretical models, scale models, heuristic models,caricature models, didactic models, fantasy models, toy models,imaginary models, mathematical models, substitute models, iconicmodels, formal models, analogue models and instrumental models are butsome of the notions that are used to categorize models. While at firstglance this abundance is overwhelming, it can quickly be brought undercontrol by recognizing that these notions pertain to different problemsthat arise in connection with models. For example, models raisequestions in semantics (what is the representational function thatmodels perform?), ontology (what kind of things are models?),epistemology (how do we learn with models?), and, of course, in generalphilosophy of science (how do models relate to theory?; what are theimplications of a model based approach to science for the debates overscientific realism, reductionism, explanation and laws of nature?).},

  abstract = {The vast majority of scientific articles published to-date have not been accompanied by concomitant publication of the underlying research data upon which they are based. This state of affairs precludes the routine re-use and re-analysis of research data, undermining the efficiency of the scientific enterprise, and compromising the credibility of claims that cannot be independently verified. It may be especially important to make data available for the most influential studies that have provided a foundation for subsequent research and theory development. Therefore, we launched an initiative\textemdash the Data Ark\textemdash to examine whether we could retrospectively enhance the preservation and accessibility of important scientific data. Here we report the outcome of our efforts to retrieve, preserve, and liberate data from 111 of the most highly-cited articles published in psychology and psychiatry between 2006\textendash 2011 (n = 48) and 2014\textendash 2016 (n = 63). Most data sets were not made available (76/111, 68\%, 95\% CI [60, 77]), some were only made available with restrictions (20/111, 18\%, 95\% CI [10, 27]), and few were made available in a completely unrestricted form (15/111, 14\%, 95\% CI [5, 22]). Where extant data sharing systems were in place, they usually (17/22, 77\%, 95\% CI [54, 91]) did not allow unrestricted access. Authors reported several barriers to data sharing, including issues related to data ownership and ethical concerns. The Data Ark initiative could help preserve and liberate important scientific data, surface barriers to data sharing, and advance community discussions on data stewardship.},

  abstract = {Scientists abstract hypotheses from observations of the world, which they then deploy to test their reliability. The best way to test reliability is to predict an effect before it occurs. If we can manipulate the independent variables (the efficient causes) that make it occur, then ability to predict makes it possible to control. Such control helps to isolate the relevant variables. Control also refers to a comparison condition, conducted to see what would have happened if we had not deployed the key ingredient of the hypothesis: scientific knowledge only accrues when we compare what happens in one condition against what happens in another. When the results of such comparisons are not definitive, metrics of the degree of efficacy of the manipulation are required. Many of those derive from statistical inference, and many of those poorly serve the purpose of the cumulation of knowledge. Without ability to replicate an effect, the utility of the principle used to predict or control is dubious. Traditional models of statistical inference are weak guides to replicability and utility of results. Several alternatives to null hypothesis testing are sketched: Bayesian, model comparison, and predictive inference (prep). Predictive inference shows, for example, that the failure to replicate most results in the Open Science Project was predictable. Replicability is but one aspect of scientific understanding: it establishes the reliability of our data and the predictive ability of our formal models. It is a necessary aspect of scientific progress, even if not by itself sufficient for understanding.},

For example, how do clinicians reconcile discordant results of randomized trials or how do they apply results of randomized trials to individual patients? In an attempt to examine such problems in a structured way, this essay describes EBM within a philosophical framework of science. Using this approach, some of the problems and challenges faced by EBM can be explained at a more fundamental level. As well as by employing a similar description of the competing alternative research tradition of clinical medicine, this essay not only highlights the philosophical differences between these two modes of medical practice, but suggests that they, in fact, play a de facto complementary role in current clinical medicine.},

  abstract = {The term big data encompasses a wide range of approaches of collecting and analyzing data in ways that were not possible before the era of modern personal computing. One approach to big data of great potential to psychologists is web scraping, which involves the automated collection of information from webpages. Although web scraping can create massive big datasets with tens of thousands of variables, it can also be used to create modestly sized, more manageable datasets with tens of variables but hundreds of thousands of cases, well within the skillset of most psychologists to analyze, in a matter of hours. In this article, we demystify web scraping methods as currently used to examine research questions of interest to psychologists. First, we introduce an approach called theory-driven web scraping in which the choice to use web-based big data must follow substantive theory. Second, we introduce data source theories, a term used to describe the assumptions a researcher must make about a prospective big data source in order to meaningfully scrape data from it. Critically, researchers must derive specific hypotheses to be tested based upon their data source theory, and if these hypotheses are not empirically supported, plans to use that data source should be changed or eliminated. Third, we provide a case study and sample code in Python demonstrating how web scraping can be conducted to collect big data along with links to a web tutorial designed for psychologists. Fourth, we describe a 4-step process to be followed in web scraping projects. Fifth and finally, we discuss legal, practical and ethical concerns faced when conducting web scraping projects.},

This paper situates the UMETRICS effort in the context of research evaluation and ongoing data infrastructure efforts in order to highlight its novel and valuable features. Refocusing data construction in this field around individuals, networks, and teams offers dramatic possibilities for data linkage, the evaluation of research investments, and the development of rigorous conceptual and empirical models. Two preliminary analyses of the scientific workforce and network approaches to characterizing scientific teams ground a discussion of future directions and a call for increased community engagement.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To identify ways to improve the usefulness of systematic reviews for health care managers and policy-makers that could then be evaluated prospectively. Methods: We systematically reviewed studies of decision-making by health care managers and policy-makers, conducted interviews with a purposive sample of them in Canada and the United Kingdom (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 29), and reviewed the websites of research funders, producers/purveyors of research, and journals that include them among their target audiences (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 45). Results: Our systematic review identi\textcent ed that factors such as interactions between researchers and health care policy-makers and timing/timeliness appear to increase the prospects for research use among policymakers. Our interviews with health care managers and policy-makers suggest that they would bene\textcent t from having information that is relevant for decisions highlighted for them (e.g. contextual factors that a\textexclamdown ect a review's local applicability and information about the bene\textcent ts, harms/risks and costs of interventions) and having reviews presented in a way that allows for rapid scanning for relevance and then graded entry (such as one page of take-home messages, a three-page executive summary and a 25-page report). Managers and policy-makers have mixed views about the helpfulness of recommendations. Our analysis of websites found that contextual factors were rarely highlighted, recommendations were often provided and graded entry formats were rarely used. Conclusions: Researchers could help to ensure that the future \textsterling ow of systematic reviews will better inform health care management and policy-making by involving health care managers and policy-makers in their production and better highlighting information that is relevant for decisions. Research funders could help to ensure that the global stock of systematic reviews will better inform health care management and policymaking by supporting and evaluating local adaptation processes such as developing and making available online more user-friendly `front ends' for potentially relevant systematic reviews.},

  abstract = {[Editor's Note: The following new entry by Thomas Nickles replaces the former entry on this topic by the previous authors.], Many scientists, philosophers, and laypersons have regarded science asthe one human enterprise that successfully escapes the contingenciesof history to establish eternal truths about the universe, via aspecial, rational method of inquiry. Historicists oppose this view. Inthe 1960s several historically informed philosophers of sciencechallenged the then-dominant accounts of scientific method advanced bythe Popperians and the positivists (the logical positivists andlogical empiricists) for failing to fit historical scientific practiceand failing particularly to account for deep scientific change. Whileseveral strands of historicism originated in nineteenth-centuryhistoriography, this article focuses, first, on the historicistconceptions of scientific rationality that became prominent in the1960s and 1970s, as the maturation of the field of historiography ofscience began to suggest competing models of scientific development,and, second, on recent approaches such as historical epistemology., The ``Battle of the Big Systems'' of the 1960s and`70s, involving historicists such as Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos,Paul Feyerabend, and Larry Laudan, eventually gave way to a realistreaction, as many philosophers rejected the perceived skepticism andpotential relativism of the historicist movement, now reinforced bynew-wave sociology of science. The 1990s featured the so-calledScience Wars, as philosophers attempted to defend truth, rationality,objectivity, and scientific progress (and their own turf) from theperceived threats of rapidly developing, sociology-inspired scienceand technology studies and (other) postmodern influences. Since then,a group of interdisciplinary scholars have attempted to reimagine waysin which historical and philosophical work can be brought togetherfruitfully.},

Placing design-based research together with teachers` action research into one single method, this study takes a pragmatic approach in accordance with Dewey's (1938) philosophy on democratic change in education. Its participatory methodological framework includes stakeholders directly into the discourse about educational improvements and reforms. To make my claims substantial, I will elucidate why teachers' practical knowledge is of paramount importance for bridging the well-known gap between theory and practice. I will exemplify the constructed method with a research project exploring the potential of The Simpsons for bilingual Politics \& Economics classes. I will argue that the overall approach I offer makes practical knowledge become scientific. Additionally, considerations for including design-based action research as a methodological pathway into teacher education are mentioned.},

In this review, we summarize key principles and resources from data visualization research that help address this difficult challenge. We then survey how visualization is being used in a selection of emerging biomedical research areas, including three-dimensional genomics, single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), the protein structure universe, phosphoproteomics, augmented reality\textendash assisted surgery, and metagenomics. While specific research areas need highly tailored visualizations, there are common challenges that can be addressed with general methods and strategies. Also common, however, are poor visualization practices. We outline ongoing initiatives aimed at improving visualization practices in biomedical research via better tools, peer-to-peer learning, and interdisciplinary collaboration with computer scientists, science communicators, and graphic designers. These changes are revolutionizing how we see and think about our data.},

  abstract = {The term ``basic research'' is ubiquitous in present debates on policy in science and higher education. It is a term with positive connotations, important for example in legitimising traditional universities. The popular term ``research'' generally corresponds to ``research and development'' (R\&D) in official statistics. This includes ``applied research'' and ``technological development'' as well as ``basic research.'' In public discourse these distinctions are regularly overlooked. ``Research'' simply includes'' the whole of R\&D. The public neglect of the differences corresponds to a trend in science studies. Within present historical, philosophical, sociological, economic, etc. studies of science and technology there is a strong tendency to play down the difference between applied and basic research, or between science and technology, or explicitly to reject it as relevant to the politics or governance of science. This paper argues that more respect for these differences would improve the chances of developing a politics of science to serve society as a whole and not only the special interests of certain groups, be they private enterprises, political movements, particular religions, the scientific community, or others.},

  abstract = {Failures to replicate published psychological research findings have contributed to a ``crisis of confidence.'' Several reasons for these failures have been proposed, the most notable being questionable research practices and data fraud. We examine replication from a different perspective and illustrate that current intuitive expectations for replication are unreasonable. We used computer simulations to create thousands of ideal replications, with the same participants, wherein the only difference across replications was random measurement error. In the first set of simulations, study results differed substantially across replications as a result of measurement error alone. This raises questions about how researchers should interpret failed replication attempts, given the large impact that even modest amounts of measurement error can have on observed associations. In the second set of simulations, we illustrated the difficulties that researchers face when trying to interpret and replicate a published finding. We also assessed the relative importance of both sampling error and measurement error in producing variability in replications. Conventionally, replication attempts are viewed through the lens of verifying or falsifying published findings. We suggest that this is a flawed perspective and that researchers should adjust their expectations concerning replications and shift to a meta-analytic mind-set.},

  year = {2013},

  pages = {9},
  abstract = {Background: The number of retracted scientific publications has risen sharply, but it is unclear whether this reflects an increase in publication of flawed articles or an increase in the rate at which flawed articles are withdrawn. Methods and Findings: We examined the interval between publication and retraction for 2,047 retracted articles indexed in PubMed. Time-to-retraction (from publication of article to publication of retraction) averaged 32.91 months. Among 714 retracted articles published in or before 2002, retraction required 49.82 months; among 1,333 retracted articles published after 2002, retraction required 23.82 months (p,0.0001). This suggests that journals are retracting papers more quickly than in the past, although recent articles requiring retraction may not have been recognized yet. To test the hypothesis that time-to-retraction is shorter for articles that receive careful scrutiny, time-to-retraction was correlated with journal impact factor (IF). Time-to-retraction was significantly shorter for high-IF journals, but only ,1\% of the variance in time-toretraction was explained by increased scrutiny. The first article retracted for plagiarism was published in 1979 and the first for duplicate publication in 1990, showing that articles are now retracted for reasons not cited in the past. The proportional impact of authors with multiple retractions was greater in 1972\textendash 1992 than in the current era (p,0.001). From 1972\textendash 1992, 46.0\% of retracted papers were written by authors with a single retraction; from 1993 to 2012, 63.1\% of retracted papers were written by single-retraction authors (p,0.001). Conclusions: The increase in retracted articles appears to reflect changes in the behavior of both authors and institutions. Lower barriers to publication of flawed articles are seen in the increase in number and proportion of retractions by authors with a single retraction. Lower barriers to retraction are apparent in an increase in retraction for ``new'' offenses such as plagiarism and a decrease in the time-to-retraction of flawed work.},

Even though several qualitative research synthesists have recommended purposeful sampling for synthesizing qualitative research, the published literature holds sparse discussion on how different strategies for purposeful sampling may be applied to a research synthesis. In primary research, Patton is frequently cited as an authority on the topic of purposeful sampling. In Patton's original texts that are referred to in this article, Patton does not make any suggestion of using purposeful sampling for research synthesis. This article makes a unique contribution to the literature by examining the adaptability of each of Patton's 16 purposeful sampling strategies to the process of qualitative research synthesis. It illuminates how different purposeful sampling strategies might be particularly suited to constructing multi-perspectival, emancipatory, participatory and deconstructive interpretations of published research.},

  abstract = {Background: When reading reports of medical research findings, one is usually confronted with p-values. Publications typically contain not just one p-value, but an abundance of them, mostly accompanied by the word ``significant.'' This article is intended to help readers understand the problem of multiple p-values and how to deal with it. Methods: When multiple p-values appear in a single study, this is usually a problem of multiple testing. A number of valid approaches are presented for dealing with the problem. This article is based on classical statistical methods as presented in many textbooks and on selected specialized literature. Results: Conclusions from publications with many ``significant'' results should be judged with caution if the authors have not taken adequate steps to correct for multiple testing. Researchers should define the goal of their study clearly at the outset and, if possible, define a single primary endpoint a priori. If the study is of an exploratory or hypothesis-generating nature, it should be clearly stated that any positive results might be due to chance and will need to be confirmed in further targeted studies. Conclusions: It is recommended that the word ``significant'' be used and interpreted with care. Readers should assess articles critically with regard to the problem of multiple testing. Authors should state the number of tests that were performed. Scientific articles should be judged on their scientific merit rather than by the number of times they contain the word ``significant.''},

Such reproducibility crisis in science could severely undermine public trust in science and science-based public policy. Recent efforts to promote reproducible research mainly focused on matured scientists and much less on student training. In this study, we conducted action research on students in data science to evaluate to what extent students are ready for communicating reproducible data analysis. The results show that although two-thirds of the students claimed they were able to reproduce results in peer reports, only one-third of reports provided all necessary information for replication. The actual replication results also include conflicting claims; some lacked comparisons of original and replication results, indicating that some students did not share a consistent understanding of what reproducibility means and how to report replication results. The findings suggest that more training is needed to help data science students communicating reproducible data analysis.},
